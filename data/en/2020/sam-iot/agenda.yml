             <p>Open source software is ubiquitous – all across the stack, in the cloud and on-premise, 
             on all devices, in commercial and non-commercial offerings. This success, the dependency 
             of the software industry on open source, combined with recent data breaches and attacks, 
             puts security into the spotlight. This talk will provide an overview - for sure opinionated, 
             hopefully controversial – about the state of affairs and current trends regarding the security 
             of software supply chains, both from consumer and producer perspective.</p>
