      <p><strong>Keynote</strong>: Cobbles and Potholes – On the Bumpy Road to Secure Software Supply Chains</p>
      <p>Open source software is ubiquitous – all across the stack, in the cloud and on-premise, on all devices, 
      in commercial and non-commercial offerings. This success, the dependency of the software industry on open source, 
      combined with recent data breaches and attacks, puts security into the spotlight. This talk will provide an overview - 
      for sure opinionated, hopefully controversial – about the state of affairs and current trends regarding the security 
      of software supply chains, both from consumer and producer perspective.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Security is one of the crucial challenges in the design and development of IoT applications. 
             This paper presents an approach that focuses on existing security standards to evaluate and 
             analyse the potential risks faced by IoT systems. It begins by identifying system assets and 
             their associated vulnerabilities and threats. A list of security objectives and technical 
             requirements are then defined to mitigate the risks and build a secure and safe system. 
             We use our approach to assess risks in the robotic system for supporting the movement of loads 
             in a warehouse.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The launching and linking process of heterogeneous objects to the Internet of Things (IoT) is 
             related to some important problems of the identification, authentication for ensuring security 
             over the wireless connections. This research study is related to the implementation of safeguard

             stage for launching into the working area of the IoT. This research aims to evaluate some safety 
             means related to the identification and authentication stages of objects by integrating them with 
             the functionality of blockchain. The objectives of this research are related to the development of 
             more safety working algorithms by representing the stages of checking the identity of the IoT objects. 
             The results demonstrated integration possibilities of implementing the blockchain functionality for 
             establishing and managing the operational rules for pre-connection stages of objects to the IoT. 
             The paper shows new results of developing protection means for ensuring reliable communication in 
             the transmission of outgoing confidential data and transmission data integrity from smart devices. 
             As a result, components of necessary functional capabilities of the communication of IoT are developed 
             by intending to ensure the safety and reliability of the wireless connection of smart objects.</p>

      <p>Enthusiastic of Internet of Things, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics, Eliseu Moura Pereira 
      is a researcher at the Research Center for Systems & Technologies (SYSTEC) hosted in the Faculty of 
      Engineering, University of Porto (FEUP). He received an M.Sc. in Electrical and Computers Engineering 
      degree from FEUP in 2018 and is a Ph.D. candidate in Informatics Engineering since 2019. He is currently 
      involved in several projects related to Smart Manufacturing, applying concepts of interoperability, reconfiguration, 
      and analytics to Cyber-Physical Production Systems.</p>
       
      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The nowadays industrial digital revolution demands for software driven solutions where 
             reconfiguration is one of the key enablers to achieve smart manufacturing by easy deployment and code 
             reuse. Despite existing several tools and platforms that allow for software reconfiguration at the digital 
             twin / edge level, it is most of the times difficult to make use of state of the art algorithms developed 
             in the most popular programming languages due to software incompatibility. This paper presents a novel 
             framework named Dynamic INtelligent Architecture for Software MOdular REconfiguration (DINASORE) that 
             implements the industrial standard IEC 61499 based in Function Blocks (FB) in Python language for 
             Cyber-Physical Production Systems' implementation. It adopts the 4DIAC-IDE as graphical user interface (GUI) 
             to ease the design and deployment of FBs to quickly and on-demand reconfigure target equipment. The proposed 
             framework provides data integration to third party platforms through the use of OPC-UA. The test scenarios 
             demonstrate that the proposed framework 1) is flexible and reliable for different applications and 2) linear 
             increases the CPU and memory workload for a large amount of FBs.</p>

      He holds a PhD in computer science from the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. His research interests range 
      from the semantics of model transformation to industrial practices in the conceptual modeling of large-scale systems.</p>
       
      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The design and development of interconnected industrial production facilities, which integrate aspects 
             of theInternet of Things (IoT) or, more specifically, the IndustrialIoT (IIoT) often deals with complex scenarios 
             involving dynamicSystem of Systems (SoS), resulting in large development anddeployment efforts. The Arrowhead 
             community aims at deliv-ering mechanisms and technologies to cope with such complexscenarios. In particular, the 
             concepts of local clouds providing aservice-oriented architecture (SOA) framework for IIoT. Here,a central 
             challenge is the conceptual modeling of such use-cases. SysML is widely established as a standardized modeling 
             language and framework for large-scale systems engineeringand, thus, for Arrowhead local cloud designs. However, 
             SysMLand its Arrowhead profile lacks a canonical way to supportactual platform modeling and device involvement 
             in heavilydistributed IIoT scenarios. The Eclipse Vorto project is ideal forfilling this gap: it provides a 
             modeling language for IoT devicesand comes with a set of modeling tools and already existingreusable templates 
             of device models. In this paper, we proposean approach to integrating Eclipse Vorto models into ArrowheadSysML 
             models. We illustrate the concept with a realistic, yetcomprehensible industrial scenario and also present a 
             prototypeto emphasize the benefits of our novel integration platform.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Internet of Things (IoT) is a pervasive technology covering many applications areas (Smart Mobility, 
             Smart Industry, Smart Healthcare, Smart Building, etc.). Its success and the technology evolution allow targeting 
             more complex and critical applications such as the management of critical infrastructures and cooperative service 
             robotics, which requires real time operation and a higher level of intelligence in the monitoring-control command 
             for decision-making. Furthermore, these applications type need to be fully validated in advance considering that bugs 
             discovered during real operation could cause significant damages. In order to avoid these drawbacks, IoT developers 
             and system integrators need advanced tools and methodologies. This paper presents a methodology and a set of tools, 
             defined and developed in the context of the BRAIN-IoT European Union (EU) project. The overall framework includes both 
             Open semantic models to enforce interoperable operations and exchange of data and control features; and Model-based 
             development tools to implement Digital Twin solutions to facilitate the prototyping and integration of interoperable 
             and reliable IoT system solutions. After describing the solution developed, this paper also presents concrete use cases 
             based on the two critical systems mentioned above, leveraging the application scenarios used to validate the concepts 
             developed and results obtained by the BRAIN-IoT project.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Thanks to Building Energy and Comfort Managements (BECM) systems, it is possible monitor and control 
             buildings with the aim to ease appliance management and at the same time ensuring efficient use of them from the 
             energetic point of view. To develop such kind of systems, it is necessary to monitor users' habits, learning their 
             preferences and predicting their sequences of performed activities and appliance usage during the day. To this aim, 
             in this paper a system capable of controlling home appliances according to user preferences and trying to reduce 
             energy consumption is proposed. The main objective of the system is to learn users' daily behaviour and to be able 
             to predict their future activities basing on statistical data about the activities they usually perform. The system 
             can then execute a scheduling algorithm of the appliances based on the expected energy consumption and user 
             annoyance related with shifting the appliance starting time from their preferred one. Experimental results 
             demonstrate that thanks to the scheduling algorithm energy cost can be reduced of 50.43% and 49.2% depending on 
             different tariffs, just by shifting the use of the appliance to time periods of non-peak hours. Scheduling based on 
             probability evaluation of preferred time of usage of the appliances allows to still obtain evident energy savings 
             even considering the errors on predicted activities.</p>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Recently, one of the main research topics in the context of application of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) in the Smart 
             City and Industry 4.0 scenarios is the one related to the use of Robot Operating System (ROS)-based CPS. Specifically, one 
             of the main interest is to allow a ROS-based smart robot needs to communicate with other heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) 
             applications in an intelligent environment to efficiently react to the system requirements and environment changes. However, the 
             communication between the IoT systems will face many challenges and increase the cost and risks that lead to the requirement of 
             a cross-platform communication for bridging the ROS-based CPS and other heterogeneous IoT applications. This paper introduces 
             an OSGi-based adaptor, named the ROS Edge Node, for the interoperability between Robotics domain and other IoT domains, leveraging 
             the highly modular BRAIN-IoT federation, which allows to decentralize, composite and dynamically federate the heterogeneous IoT 
             platforms by leveraging OSGi. Together with the unfixed infrastructure of BRAIN-IoT solution, the event-driven asynchronous 
             communication mechanism realizes cross-platform interaction with ROS-based CPS and solves the major challenges faced. The ROS 
             Edge Node is packaged as a BRAIN-IoT Service with Requirement/Capability in metadata, similar to microservice, to be deployed 
             in a distributed BRAIN-IoT Fabric cluster as a bridge between the underlying ROS-based robotics systems and other OSGi-based 
             IoT systems in various IoT domains via an Asynchronous Eventing Substrate (BRAIN-IoT EventBus). This paper demonstrates the 
             solution developed in an service robotics use case in a warehouse to show how the OSGi-based adaptor enables the fast adaptivity 
             and interoperability between heterogeneous IoT domains in a federated environment.</p>
